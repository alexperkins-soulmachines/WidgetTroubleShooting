# Widget Troubleshooting App
This is an app built for Troubleshooting Widget API Keys and Settings. 

It includes all of the settings for deploying a Soul Machines Digital Person Widget listed here: https://soulmachines-support.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SSAS/pages/1327366145/Embedding+into+Your+Website#Customizing-the-Widget

Once deployed to a dedicated URL, it will allow us to merely ask a customer to whitelist that URL on their API key, at which point we can troubleshoot changing any properties of the widget (or testing out their Project) without needing to create a new app each time.
